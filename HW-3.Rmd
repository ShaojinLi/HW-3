## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: None
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 10 hrs
* What gave you the most trouble:
* Any comments you have: 


## Data

* You must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from `HW-2` to the `data` folder
in the `HW-3` directory
* We also consider all 222,540 songs played in the Reed College pool hall
jukebox from Nov 30, 2003 to Jan 22, 2009 (included in `HW-3` folder). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("data/profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
jukebox <- read.csv("data/jukebox.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
```


## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset.


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression to predict individual's gender and interpret the results for one continuous variable (if you used one) and one categorical variable of your choice

When fitting the logistic regression, you can put both the categorical variable and the numerical variable you've chosen in the same model, that way you have more information to predict gender, and only have a single set of predictions to evaluate.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#From HW2
#Split off the essays into a separate data.frame
essays<-select(profiles, contains("essay"))
profiles<-select(profiles, -contains("essay"))
# Define a binary outcome variable
profiles<-mutate(profiles, is_female=ifelse(sex=="f", 1, 0))

#Gender stats
sex<-profiles %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  tally() %>%
  rename(total_sex=n)

#Heights info
heights<-ggplot(data=profiles, aes(x=height, y=is_female)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("Height vs. Gender")+
  ylab("Female?")+
  xlab("Height")
heights

#Body type info (inspired by HW2 lab session)
sex_body<-profiles %>% 
  group_by(body_type, sex) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  inner_join(sex, by="sex") %>% 
  mutate(prop=n/total_sex)
kable(sex_body)

#Regression of gender on heights & body type
profiles_1a<-profiles %>%
  mutate(curvy=ifelse(body_type %in% c("curvy"),1,0)) %>%
  na.omit(height)

model1<-glm(is_female~height+curvy, data=profiles_1a, family=binomial(link="logit"))

kable(summary(model1)$coef, digits=2)
```

From the regression table we can see that there is a decrease of exp(-0.63) in the odds of being female when height increase 1 inch. There is an increase of exp(4.03) in the odds of being female when "curvy" is used for body type description. 


### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}_i$ for all users $i=1,
\ldots, n=59946$ in your dataset.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

profiles_1a$fitted_female<-fitted(model1)

#Plot histogram of fitted probabilities
#Draw a line at 0.5, for everyone who has a probability>0.5, predict 
#they are female; if <0.5, predict they are male

plot1b<-ggplot(data=profiles_1a, aes(x=fitted_female))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=0.1, boundary=0)+
  ggtitle("Fitted Probabilities of Being Female")+
  xlab("Probability")+
  ylab("Count")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, col="red")
plot1b

```


### c)

Use a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$ to make an explicit prediction for each
user $i$'s sex and save this in a variable `predicted_sex`. In other words, for user $i$

* If $\widehat{p}_i > p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 1` i.e. they are female
* If $\widehat{p}_i < p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 0` i.e. they are male

Display a 2 x 2 contigency table of `sex` and `predicted_sex` i.e. compare the 
predicted sex to the actual sex of all users. The sum of all the elements in
your table should be $n=59946$. Comment on how well our predictions fared.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#Compare my prediction and the actual data, see how well we actually predict
profiles_1a$predict_female<-ifelse(profiles_1a$fitted_female>0.5, 1, 0)

table1c<-profiles_1a %>%
  group_by(predict_female, is_female) %>%
  tally() %>%
  spread(is_female, n)

kable(table1c)
```

The prediction is not so accurate. Our prediction is right only if "predict_female" equalts to "is_female", which means that there are 6239 people who are male but we predict them to be female, and there are 3024 female who we predict them to be male. But because we only use two factors, heights and "curvy", to predict for gender, it is a pretty good estimation. 

### d) (bonus)

Say we wanted to have a **false positive rate** of about 20%, i.e. of the people
we predicted to be female, we want to be wrong no more than 20% of the time. What
decision threshold $p^*$ should we use?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


## Question 2:

Using the jukebox data, plot a time series of the number of songs played each
week over the entire time period. i.e.

* On the x-axis present actual dates (not something like Week 93, which doesn't 
mean anything to most people).
* On the y-axis present the total number of songs.

What seasonal (i.e. cyclical) patterns do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#Change date & time format
jukebox <- jukebox %>%
  mutate(new_date=parse_date_time(date_time, "%b %d %H%M%S %Y")) %>%
  mutate(week=round_date(new_date, "week"))

#Round to the nearest week and count number of songs
jukebox2<-jukebox %>%
  mutate(week=round_date(new_date, unit=c("week"))) %>%
  mutate(year=year(new_date)) %>%
  group_by(week) %>% 
  tally() %>%
  rename(num_songs=n)

#Plot of a time series of the number of songs played each week 
#over the entire time period
plot2a<-ggplot(jukebox2, aes(week, num_songs))+
  geom_line()+
  ggtitle("Number of Songs Played Each Week")
plot2a

#We see a similar pattern. Take a closer look at only two years
#Plot of a time series of the number of songs played each week in 2005 and 2006
jukebox3<-jukebox %>%
  mutate(week=round_date(new_date, unit=c("week"))) %>%
  mutate(year=year(new_date)) %>%
  subset(year %in% c("2005","2006"))%>%
  group_by(week) %>% 
  tally() %>%
  rename(num_songs=n)

plot2b<-ggplot(jukebox3, aes(week, num_songs))+
  geom_line()+
  ggtitle("Number of Songs Played Each Week (2005-2006)")
plot2b

```
From the plot that has year 2004-2009 we see cyclical patterns of the number of songs played each week. After taking a closer look at year 2005 and 2006, we see that in January and around July the number of songs played drops a lot. 


## Question 3:

Using the jukebox data, what are the top 10 artists played during the "graveyard
shift" during the academic year? Define

* the "graveyard shift" as midnight to 8am
* the academic year as September through May (inclusive)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

jukebox4<-jukebox %>%
  mutate(year=year(new_date),
         month=month(new_date), 
         hour= hour(new_date))%>% 
  filter(hour<8) %>%
  filter(month>=9 | month<=5) %>% 
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename(num_songs=n)

kable(head(jukebox4, 10)) 
```


## Question 4:

We want to compare the volatility of 

* bitcoin prices
* gold prices

Let our measure of volatility be the relative change from day-to-day in price. 
Let the reference currency be US dollars. Analyze these results and provide
insight to a foreign currency exchanger.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#Relative change of bitcoin price
bitcoin<-Quandl("BAVERAGE/USD",start_date="2011-01-01") %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  rename(now=`24h Average`) %>% 
  arrange(Date) %>%
  mutate(previous=lag(now),
         diff_b=(now-previous)/previous) %>%
  select(Date, diff_b) %>%
  na.omit()

#Relative change of gold price
gold<-Quandl("BUNDESBANK/BBK01_WT5511",start_date="2011-01-01") %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  rename(now=Value)%>%
  arrange(Date) %>%
  mutate(previous=lag(now),
         diff_g=(now-previous)/previous) %>%
  select(Date, diff_g) %>%
  na.omit()

#Join two datasets
gold_bitcoin<-full_join(bitcoin, gold, by="Date") %>%
  na.omit()

plot4<-ggplot(data=gold_bitcoin, aes(x=Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=diff_b, colour="Bitcoin")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=diff_g, colour="Gold"))+ 
  ggtitle("Price Volatility of Bitcoin and Gold")+
  ylab("Price Volatility")+
  xlab("Year")
plot4

```
As shown in the graph, the price volatility of bitcoin is way higher than that of gold. Therefore, gold should be a better choice of foreign currency exchanger.


## Question 5: (bonus)

Using the data loaded from Quandl below, plot a time series using `geom_line()`
comparing cheese and milk production in the US from 1930 to today. Comment on this.

* Cheese [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Cheese-Production-Measured-In-Lb)
* Milk [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Milk-Production-Measured-In-Lb)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
#  tbl_df()
#milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
#  tbl_df()
```
